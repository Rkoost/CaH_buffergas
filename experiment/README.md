# Experimental data analysis

To run the codes in the easiest way, one should check the following:

1. the modules used in import functions section is properly installed
2. move the data files to the following path: `Y:\\CryoMolEx\\CryoMolExData\\`
3. make sure all data exist in the folders in the right year, month and date as specified in the data folder name. For example, if the data folder is called `2024-04-17_Waveforms6`, the path should be `Y:\\CryoMolEx\\CryoMolExData\\2024\\04-Apr\\2024-04-17\\2024-04-17_Waveforms6`
